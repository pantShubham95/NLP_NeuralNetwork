# Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Network

This project implements sentiment analysis on textual data using deep learning techniques. The objective is to classify text into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and processed the text data for model readiness.
- **Model Building:** Implemented a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for sentiment classification.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated model accuracy and adjusted hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Visualization:** Included data visualizations such as word clouds to understand the data distribution.

## Libraries Used:
- TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, WordCloud

## Results:
Achieved an accurate model for sentiment analysis, capable of classifying sentiments in text data effectively.
